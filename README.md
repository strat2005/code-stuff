# Background
Throughout this project, there were five main questions I wanted to answer
1. What are the top paying data-analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most high in demand for data analyst jobs?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salary jobs?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
# Tools I used
For this project, I utilized three key tools used in data analytics:
- SQL: The foundation of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and gain useful insights
- PostgresSQL: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job postings data
- Visual Studio Code: Used for data management and executing SQL queries
- Git & Github: Essential for version control and sharing SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field

```sql
SELECT
    company_name,
    job_title_short,
    job_location,
    salary_year_avg
from job_postings_fact
where 
    job_work_from_home = TRUE AND
    salary_year_avg is not null AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
left join company_dim on job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
order by salary_year_avg DESC
limit 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range**: Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers**: Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety**: There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
with top_paying_jobs as (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        company_dim.name,
        job_title_short,
        job_location,
        salary_year_avg
    from job_postings_fact
    left join company_dim on job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
        where 
        job_work_from_home = TRUE AND
        salary_year_avg is not null AND
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    order by salary_year_avg DESC
    limit 10
)

select
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills
from top_paying_jobs
inner join skills_job_dim on top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
inner join skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **SQL** is leading with a bold count of 8.
- **Python** follows closely with a bold count of 7.
- **Tableau** is also highly sought after, with a bold count of 6. Other skills like R, Snowflake, Pandas, and Excel show varying degrees of demand.

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.
```sql
select
    skills,
    count(job_posted_date) as skill_count
from job_postings_fact
inner join skills_job_dim on job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
inner join skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
where
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' and
    job_work_from_home = True
group by skills
order by skill_count desc
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts in 2023

- **SQL** and **Excel** remain fundamental, emphasizing the need for strong foundational skills in data processing and spreadsheet manipulation.
- Programming and Visualization Tools like **Python**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI** are essential, pointing towards the increasing importance of technical skills in data storytelling and decision support.

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.
```sql
select
    skills,
    round(avg(salary_year_avg)) as avg_salary,
    count(job_posted_date) as skill_count
from job_postings_fact
inner join skills_job_dim on job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
inner join skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
where
    salary_year_avg is not null AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
group by skills
HAVING
    count(job_posted_date) > 500
order by avg_salary desc;
```
Here's a breakdown of the results for top paying skills for Data Analysts:

- **High Demand for Big Data & ML Skills**: Top salaries are commanded by analysts skilled in big data technologies (PySpark, Couchbase), machine learning tools (DataRobot, Jupyter), and Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy), reflecting the industry's high valuation of data processing and predictive modeling capabilities.
